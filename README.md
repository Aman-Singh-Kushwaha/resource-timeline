## What i learned :
- Learned about React RnD package
- About Event Bubble and handling multiple events
- About breaking down a product into simpler task

## Most Difficult Part
- The most difficult part was handling mouse interaction with event, and thinking about fine details like if dragging event out of month, it doesn't looses but stored in adjacent month.

## What i have done uniquely if given more time
- I would do provide role based authentication and authorization
- Integration with other tools where event is hosted, i.e. Github, Jira etc.
